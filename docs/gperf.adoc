= gperf

GNU gperf is a perfect hash function generator. The online manual is available
https://www.gnu.org/software/gperf/manual/gperf.html[here].

The integration to build system is done such a way that gperf is required only
for development. It is not required for distribution archives as those have
resulting C files included.


== Usage

To use gperf you have to create gperf file. To include it in the build system
you have to add source file to your project that is processed by it. The code is
simply `gperf.process("your.gperf")` for `your.gperf` file. Investigate the
`libfoo/meson.build` file to see it.


== Removal

If you do not need gperf then you can remove the `gperf` assignment in the top
level `meson.build`.
